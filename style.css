Description: The fact that over the years we have more and more powerful computers and faster and faster connections does not mean that the page of a website should weigh 5MB. The main purpose that a website should have is to inform, and if we consider that a large (huge) ebook does not exceed an average of 2.5 MB it makes us understand how absurd it is to have to download 5MB of data from the network to read a single article. The purpose of Simple.css Theme Wordpress is to allow authors to write a blog of any kind, offering readers a product that can be used even with the slowest connection and the oldest computer. With my Packard Bell Dot S, I can't read most of the currently existing websites without long waits. Simple.css Theme Wordpress was born from the need to create blogs and sites light and fast and is offered to allow anyone who wants to create blogs with pages of size, not compressed, less than 100KB. It is a theme focused on writing and dedicated to those who need a personal website for any purpose, whether it is a work resume, portfolio, personal. It is not suitable for magazines or ecommerce.
